2023-8-17 Release Notes
    * 1.2 Released
    * Added a version number to libasync_simple.so in CMakeScripts.
    * Added sharedMutex
    * Added chore(bazel) async_simple_dependencies
    * Added `dispatch(Executor*)` helper function to schedule the current
      Lazy corotuine to another executor.
    * Added a limit that we can only `co_await` a Lazy in a Lazy Function.
    * Added an explicit requirement that the alignment of `T` in `Lazy<T>`
      can't exceed `alignof(std::max_align_t)` (which 16 generally) due to
      a language defect.
    * Added lazy_local features so that the users can specify the LazyLocal
      data across the Lazy Calling chain.
    * Improved experimenting modules support.
    * Improved cmake support for msvc
    * Introduced xmake support for modules building.
    * Optimized FutureAwaiter so that we can reduce the scheduling time when
      we `co_await` a `async_simple::Future`. The semantics remains the same.
    * Removed SimpleIOExecutor and SimpleExecutor from async_simple since they
      are for testing only and we encourage people to use their own executors
      for their own situations.

2023-4-23  Release Notes
    * 1.1 Released
    * SimpleExecutor will execute all the scheduled task before destructing
    * `co_await` a lvalue Future is deprected now. We should move the future
    explicitly before `co_await`.
    * Use std::variant instead of union in Try
    * Provided future<void> and promise<void>
    * Added `value()` and `index()` interfaces to `CollectAnyResult`
    * Added `future::then` interface
    * Added `coro::Latch`
    * Added `coro::Semaphore`
    * Added Generator
    * Added start_switch_fiber and finish_switch_fiber for uthread to enable address sanitizer
    * Force RescheduleLazy to be allowed in DetachedCoroutine only
    * Added C++20 modules support
    * Added the second version of uthread::async
    * Added Mutex benchmark
    * Added SpinLock benchmark
    * Added multiple core echo server example
    * Added AsioCallbackAwaiter
    * Added ppc64_le support for uthread
    * Improved bazel support
    * Added support for macos
    * Added support for windows
    * Added ubuntu and centos7 Dockerfile
    * Fixed several compile failures
